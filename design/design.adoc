== Envelope Calculations Per Cluster


* Taxi
    - Number of Taxi Registered: 200,000
    - Number of Shifts: `3x16` Hours each
    - Active Taxis Average: 2/3 x N = `130,000`
    - Location Updates: 130,000/m = 130,000/60/second ~= `2100/sec`

* Users
    - Number of registered users: 10,00,000
    - Peak Query: N/10 = 1,00,000/1 hour = 27.77/s ~= `30/sec`
    - Average Load: N/10 = 1,00,000/day ~ `2/second`
    - SLA Average Load: Taxi lookup under 60 seconds
    - SLA Peak Load: Taxi Lookup under 120 seconds

== Architecture Designs

{nbsp}

There are three actors in whole project representing three real world entities.

1. _Server_: Cloud based application which handles all the business logic
2. _Taxi_: A client that represents a taxi for hire. A registered taxi can receive pick up request nearby
3. _User_: A client that represents a person who wants to hire a taxi for travel. A registered user can ask for an
   available taxi nearby

There are three distinct categories of communication between clients (user/taxi) and server.

1. *_Synchronous Requests_*: These are requests by clients which requires immediate responses with blocking I/O. Example
   of such requests are _login_, _logout_, _cancel_taxi_, _register_ and so on. Since these are less frequently used, it
   makes sense to use simple _Client-Server_ Communication model here. A `ReST` Api over HTTPs is a good fit for these
   requests.
2. *_Long Term Continuous Communication_*: These are data exchanges which are extended over long time and are frequent
   in nature. Message Queueing protocol `MQTT` based endpoint can serve data transfer between client and server for
   these requests. Example data transfer could be _location update_ sent by taxi, _new user request_ assigned to a taxi,
   _changes in ongoing ride_, _cancellation of a ride by user_ and so on.
3. *_Short Term Continuous Communication_*: These are data exchanges which are done over short time and are frequent
   in nature. A `WebSocket` based endpoint can serve data transfer between client and server for these requests. This
   could be used for sending updates when a user _searches for taxi ride_. A user request can be kept live until a taxi
   is assigned for user request.

=== `High Level Organization`

image::img/high_level_architecture.png[]

Below are the components that are used in the system design for serving different purposes. The components are numbered
and are explained in natural order of the numbering.

1. *API Gateway (ReST):* A HTTP endpoint that serves the synchronous requests to register a user or taxi in the system.
   Requests are forwarded to a Lambda which internal does the required validations and creates a new entry in database.
2. *SNS Topic(s):* These SNS Topics that are exposed over internet. Each topic allows queue
   based communication with a taxi. SNS allows large number of clients to be subscribed, it becomes possible to
   scale clients simply by adding more topics or partitions. Taxi sends location updates by publishing messages into one
   of these _topics_. Also, taxi subscribes to an exclusive topic to send and read exclusive messages for it
3. *Lambda Functions:* Used to perform logic on the request incoming from taxi or user
4. *User Database:* Houses data for registered Users and Taxis along with some metadata. A document database like
   _MongoDb_ or _DynamoDb_ would be an ideal candidate for these operations
5. *GeoSpatial Data:* A DB or Cache that supports GeoSpatial queries. Possible candidates are MongoDb, ElastiCache or
   Redis Cache
6. *Status Data:* In-Memory cache that holds status for users, taxi and current rides

=== `API: User/Taxi Registration`

image::img/flow_user_registration.png[]

A user and taxi needs to be registered within the system to be able to use the service. In effect, _registration_ Api
becomes the first interaction of user with the system. The flow goes like below

 1. User/Taxi makes a `HTTP POST` call to `/register` Api with JSON payload. Payload contains specific information
    about a new user or taxi
 2. Request is recieved by API Gateway and is routed to a _register lambda_ function
 3. Register Lambda function does the validation for duplicates and integrity
 4. On validation success, a new record is made in the Mongo Db that will serve as a store for user and taxi
 5. A success response is sent back with assigned User Id and possibly a Token

On a _success_ response client is supposed to persist the data locally along with the assigned `Id`.

_Extension Point:_ As part of payload, Client can send a Public Key that can be stored in Mongo Record. This Public Key,
then becomes the basis for `JWT` based authentication.

=== `API: Taxi Login`

image::img/flow_taxi_login.png[]

Once a taxi successfully registers with system, it gets an `Id` and a `Token`. Using these two taxi can start or stop
getting pickup requests from system. The flow goes like below;

1. Taxi makes a `POST /login` call with below structure;
  - `taxi_id` as a Header
  - `jwt` as a Header
  - JSON Payload as the formulated JWT Payload
  ``
   {
     "taxi_id": "<string:id>",
     "expiry": <int:epoch>,
     "nonce": "<string:random>"
   }
  ``
2. Request is received by API Gateway endpoint and is validated by an authentication lambda. Then it is routed to a
   Login Lambda
3. Login Lambda validates the current status and updates the status data marking the taxi as available for new requests.
   It then proceeds to create a Topic in format `topic/taxi-<id>` to enable one-to-one communication between server
   and taxi
4. Okay response is sent back to Taxi indicating a successful login for taxi
5. Taxi client then subscribes to an exclusive topic `topic/taxi-<id>` to enable exclusive communication channel
6. Taxi client then starts publishing periodic location messages onto the topic `topic/taxi-location`
7. Location messages are served by a Location Lambda. A SQS Queue invokes Lambda for batches of MQTT messages. This
   lambda first verifies that the Taxi is still logged in using status data
8. If it is online, the current location is written into the _Geo Spatial Data_

Once taxi wants to stop serving request, a `/logoff` Api call is made which is routed to same Login Lambda. Once the
request is validated, the taxi entry is removed from _status data_ and exlusive topic `topic/taxi-<id>` is deleted. Any
further location updates will be then discarded.


=== `API: Taxi Booking`

image::img/flow_taxi_booking.png[]

Once a user successfully registers with system, it gets an `Id` and a `Token`. Using these two, user can start booking
taxi from system. The flow goes like below;

1. User makes a `POST /taxi-request` call with below structure;
  - `user_id` as a Header
  - `jwt` as a Header
  - JSON Payload as the formulated JWT Payload

   {
     "user_id": "<string:id>",
     "expiry": <int:epoch>,
     "nonce": "<string:random>",
     "location" : {
        "longitude": "<decimal:long>",
        "latidude": "<decimal:lat>"
     }
   }

2. Request is received by API Gateway endpoint and is validated by an authentication lambda. Then it is routed to a
   Taxi Request Lambda
3. Lambda validates the location and fires `nearest K` query on _Geo Spatial Data_ which outputs upto `K` taxi `Id`
4. Lambda then sends a pickup request to all nearest taxis via `taxi-<id>` topics
5. The first positive response from the taxi is considered as a valid selection
6. When the accepting confirmation arrives within time limit, taxi can be assigned the trip
7. Taxi status is updated with the trip in progress flag and trip id
8. Connection is closed indicating request service complete. In case no taxi was assigned, user can retry after sometime

Trip information is stored in _status data_ against user and taxi so that we do not assigned any other trip to taxi or
user.
