### Team Members
 - Drisya
 - Shanger
 - Nilotpal
 - Anirudh
 
## Code Structure

- `src`: contains source code for each component in their respective directories. shared code will be found under `shared` folder
- `design`: contains documentation regarding system design and choices we made along the way
- `presentation`: contains final presentation for the project along with any supporting documents
- `guides`: contains how to guides to help out in initial phase of code

## Coding Choices

- Language: `python`
- Patterns: `OOPS` and `SOLID` based
- Diagram Tool: `draw.io` (XML Format)
- Logging Format: `json`
- Merge Request Commit: `squash` (do not use `merge`; that looks ugly). ALWAYS rebase your code before rasing a pull request

## General Coding Guideline

- Use `PyCharm IDE`, works like a charm :)
- Fork this repository and start coding
- Use below header for each python file

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
