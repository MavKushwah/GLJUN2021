=== Intermediate Submission [30/May/2022]

'''


==== #1: Identify and configure your main data storage and central processing system

- Status: COMPLETED
- Storage engine has been identified as Mongo Atlas
- Central Processing system is based on API-Gateway/Lambda stack
- For asynchronous communication between Server and Client, a MQTT Broker deployed on a EC2 machine has been used
- System Design and Architecture has been documented under `design` folder

==== #2: Define the structure for your area boundary

- Right now we have used a rectangular bound with four parameters
** Min & Max Latitude
** Min & Max Longitude
- Taxi and Clients are free to move outside these bounds
- Server will filter Taxi and User as "Out of Service" area (subject to bugs in code)
- We are looking to extend to a Polygon which can be used with `intersection` to find if a point is within Polygon

==== #3: Build the taxi simulator with natural-looking lat-long data generation

- Taxi Client is ready and takes bound as input parameters (rectangular bound as of now)
- It randomly chooses a location within bound to start with, then it slowly moves with displacement of `0.005` degrees

==== #4: Identify and implement the means to transfer this data regularly to your central system

- Location update is sent via an JWT authenticated ReST Api
- Data is consumed by server using a Lambda which updates taxi location in the Mongo Document
- The Location is stored as dictated by Mongo specs for `GeoSpatial` format

==== #5: Ingest and store the taxi lat-long data appropriately

- Latest location of a taxi is stored in a unique document in Mongo Db
- Location Lambda (`functions/location.py`) reads the location from client request and stores in the appropriate format

==== #6: Be able to show the stored data visually in a database UI or just through a utility code dumping data in some structured format based on time

- We decided to use the Mongo Atlas as our data store
- Implicitly it allows to visualize taxi location in a Map as a Chart in dashboard

==== #7: Visually display a map-equivalent view of your area, showing taxi positions. As specified earlier, this doesnâ€™t have to be a real map with general location data

- Mongo Atlas provided this functionality

=== NOTES FROM TEAM
'''

At this moment the code is ready with these functionalities (subject to bugs):

* Registration support for Taxi and User
* Async communication to Taxi and User via MQTT Broker
* JWT based Authentication ReST Api
* Randomized/One-Time MQTT Topics for Taxi Logins and User Requests
* Location data ingestion from Taxi Client via ReST API
* Live updates to User Client when booking for taxi
* Taxi can choose to Accept or Reject a ride request. Race conditions handled by server in case of multiple taxi
  accepting a request

A few more nuggets;

* Fully automated Cloud Formation Deployment of Server Stack
* `make` based command execution to avoid human error in deployment
* Stacks are based on `namespaces` that allows parallel stack in same account to run
* A Flask App to emulate whole system end-to-end while testing locally
